* Walmart E-Commerce Sales Analysis

Hi there! This project explores purchasing patterns in Walmart’s e-commerce data. I used **Excel** and **Power BI** to dig into customer behavior and highlight insights that could help a business make smarter decisions.



* What Was the Goal?

To understand how different customer groups shop — based on gender, age, city, occupation, and product categories — and present those insights through clean, easy-to-read visuals.

The idea was to replicate what a data analyst might do in a real-world retail setting.



* Tools I Used

- **Excel** – for cleaning the raw data and doing some quick pivots  
- **Power BI** – to create an interactive dashboard  
- **GitHub** – to store, version, and share everything



* Questions I Wanted to Answer

- Who shops more — men or women?  
- Which age group is most active?  
- Which cities bring in the most revenue?  
- What are the top product categories?  
- Do job roles or marital status impact spending?



* What I Found

- Men account for a much larger share of purchases  
- Shoppers aged **26–35** are the most active  
- **City B** brings in about 41.5% of total revenue  
- Customers in **Occupation Code 4** spend the most  
- **Product Category 1** is the most popular  
- Average customer spend is around **$9.26K**
