Walmart E-Commerce Sales Analysis

Welcome! This is a real-world data analytics project where I explored purchasing patterns of Walmart's e-commerce customers. Using Excel and Power BI, I analysed key customer segments and visualized insights that can help inform business decisions.



* Project Objective

To analyse customer behaviour based on gender, age, city, occupation, and product categories, and present clear business insights through visual storytelling. This project simulates how a data analyst might support decision-making in a retail e-commerce setting.



* Tools Used

- Excel – For data cleaning, transformation, and pivot analysis
- Power BI – For dashboard building and interactive visualisation
- GitHub – To version and share the project



* Key Questions Explored

- Which age group and gender contribute most to overall sales?
- Which city generates the highest purchase volume?
- Which product categories are the most popular?
- Do occupation or marital status influence spending?
- What's the average purchase value?



* Key Insights

- Male customers contribute a significantly higher share of purchases than female customers.
- The 26–35 age group is the most active in terms of purchase volume.
- City B leads with the highest revenue share (~41.5%).
- Customers with Occupation Code 4 spend the most.
- Product Category 1 dominates overall sales volume.
- The average purchase value is around $9.26K per customer.
